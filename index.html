				I am originally from Rocky Mount, NC; where I was born and reared for the first 18 years of my life. After graduating high school I went to Appalachian State University in Boone, NC for the next four years. After graduating with a BSBA in Hospitality and Tourism Management, I worked in hospitality over the next four years in various positions. When the opportunity came for me to move to Raleigh, NC and begin working for a company in client services, I was happy to make the move and begin working a more steady Monday through Friday job. Over the past eight years I have worked for a local triangle healthcare technology company and moved up from a client services represenative to now V.P. of Operations.

				In my personal life, I have a girlfriend with whom we have been dating for fifteen years and I married her seven years ago. Twelve years ago we got a little Westie who is still going strong. And a year and a half ago we had a beautiful little girl, who is teaching me new things every day.
